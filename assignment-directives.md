The following mail was sent to me along with the assignment instructions. The PDF can be found in this repository.

## Mail content

Attached is the PDF file with instructions to our coding assignment. You can also use our provided skeleton code at [https://github.com/yaraku/nlp-engineer-assignment](https://github.com/yaraku/nlp-engineer-assignment).

It provides you with some functions and includes the dataset so it will save you some time. If you have trouble getting the environment to work properly, feel free to use the provided Dockerfile. You can take up to 2 weeks to work on it. Submit your code by committing to a repository on Bitbucket or Github and then telling me the repo link. After submission, I will pass your code to the NLP Team for evaluation. Based on their assessment, I will contact you again for the next step of the hiring process. 

Things that we will be looking for in your assignment: 
- Accurate Transformer and training loop implementations that achieve a reasonable accuracy on the task. For reference, our implementation achieves over 98% accuracy. 
- Clean, readable, maintainable and well-structured code. 
- A working API that correctly serves the trained model to make predictions. 

Recommendations: 
- Good commit log that shows your workflow is a plus. Commit messages like "It works", "fixed", "work in progress" decrease your chances of passing the test. Spelling errors in variable names, comments, or readme lower your chances too. 
- Make sure that all required features are implemented. If you feel like you need more time to complete the assignment, feel free to ask for an extension. - Including additional unit tests for your implementations is a plus.
